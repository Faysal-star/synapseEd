# PDF Chat Feature in Resource Management

This document explains how to use the PDF chat feature in the Resource Management page.

## Overview

The PDF chat feature allows users to interact with PDFs using natural language. The system processes the PDF, indexes its content, and enables users to ask questions about the document. The AI assistant uses both its general knowledge and the specific content of the PDF to provide relevant answers.

## How to Use

1. **Select a PDF**: Double-click on any PDF file in the resource management interface. This will:
   - Load the PDF for processing
   - Automatically open the chat sidebar
   - Display a welcome message indicating the PDF is loaded

2. **Ask Questions**: Type your question in the chat input field at the bottom of the sidebar and press Enter or click the send button. Questions can include:
   - Specific information from the PDF
   - Summaries of sections
   - Explanations of concepts mentioned in the document
   - Connections between ideas in the document

3. **View Responses**: The AI assistant will process your question and provide a response based on the content of the PDF.

4. **Clear Context**: To reset the conversation or switch to a different PDF, click the trash icon next to the current PDF name at the top of the chat panel. This will clear the conversation history and context.

## Technical Implementation

The feature integrates with the `/api/context_chat` API endpoints:

- `POST /api/context_chat`: Processes queries about the PDF content
- `DELETE /api/context_chat`: Clears the conversation context

PDFs are processed from Supabase storage URLs, where all resource files are stored. The system:

1. Uses the Supabase URL of the selected PDF
2. Sends this URL to the context chat API for processing
3. Chunks and indexes the PDF content
4. Uses vector search to find relevant content for each query
5. Generates responses based on both the relevant content and the query

## Tips for Best Results

- **Ask specific questions**: The more specific your question, the more precise the answer will be
- **Include context**: If asking about a specific section, mention it in your question
- **Follow-up questions**: You can ask follow-up questions about previous responses
- **Reset when needed**: If the conversation gets off track, use the clear context button to reset
- **Large PDFs**: For very large documents, initial processing may take a bit longer

## Limitations

- The system works best with text-based PDFs rather than scanned documents
- Very large PDFs may be truncated to fit processing limits
- Response quality depends on the clarity and structure of the PDF content
- The system may occasionally hallucinate information not in the document
