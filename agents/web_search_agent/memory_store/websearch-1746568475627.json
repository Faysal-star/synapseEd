It provides tools for creating workflows and state machines to coordinate multiple AI agents or language model interactions. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, leveraging its components while adding graph-based coordination capabilities. It's particularly useful for developing more complex, agent-based applications with advanced capabilities such as customizable architectures, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop handling.\n\nSome key features of LangGraph include:\n\n1. **Low-level orchestration framework**: LangGraph is used by companies like Replit, Uber, LinkedIn, and GitLab for building controllable agents.\n2. **Customizable architectures**: LangGraph offers customizable architectures for building AI agents.\n3. **Long-term memory**: LangGraph provides long-term memory capabilities for AI agents.\n4. **Human-in-the-loop**: LangGraph enables human-in-the-loop handling for complex tasks.\n5. **First-class streaming support**: LangGraph provides token-by-token streaming and streaming of intermediate steps, giving users clear visibility into agent reasoning and actions as they unfold in real time.\n\nLangGraph is particularly useful for creating agent and multi-agent workflows, and is considered a more professional and in-depth framework compared to other libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex.\n\nReferences:\n- LangGraph Quickstart.
